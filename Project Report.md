# Data-Analytics-Project
1. Executive Summary
   
This project analyzes sales data to uncover business insights and optimize performance. Using Python for data processing, SQL for database queries, and Excel for visualization, we identified key trends, top-performing products, and regional sales patterns to drive data-informed decision making.

Key Highlights:

Processed and analyzed 10,000+ sales records

Identified 30% revenue contribution from top product

Recommended strategies to boost underperforming regions by 15-20%

2. Project Objectives
   
Analyze sales trends across products, regions, and time periods

Identify high-value customers and products

Evaluate regional performance gaps

Provide actionable recommendations for sales optimization

3. Tools and Technologies
   
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL (PostgreSQL)

Excel/Google Sheets

Git/GitHub (Version control)

4. Methodology

Source: Mock sales database (CSV format)

Sample Data Fields:

OrderID, Date, Product, Quantity

Price, CustomerID, Region

4.2 Data Processing Pipeline

SQL Extraction:

sql
SELECT Region, Product, SUM(Quantity*Price) as Revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY Region, Product
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
